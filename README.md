# phasespace
This is the project that integrates PhaseSpace motion capture with LabVIEW applications.

## Required modules
* PSP (PhaseSpace Project):

This is the main server for this project. Try to execute PSP.exe first. Please enter the following command in the command line. The default executable file is located under x64/Release folder.
```
PSP.exe
```

* socket_target.vi:

This is the client for the socket and is written in LabVIEW, which can be integrated with other LabVIEW applications. The file is located under LabVIEW folder and can be run at either host or target computer. Only need to double-click on the vi file and run it for execution.

## Unused LabVIEW modules but still exist in the project
* socket_client.vi (deprecated):

This is the client for the socket and is written in C++. The program can be run by the SysExec module in LabVIEW. There is an example of using the SysExec module in LabVIEW under LabVIEW folder called socket_client.vi

* phasespace_server.vi (deprecated):

This is the server side for the socket and also handles the communications with the PhaseSpace machine. The vi file is responsible for the execution of the server and is also located under LabVIEW folder.
